        <p style="color: green;font-size: 20px;"><i>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. 
            It is used to design web pages using a markup language. 
            HTML is the combination of Hypertext and Markup language. 
            Hypertext defines the link between web pages. 
            A markup language is used to define the text document 
            within the tag which defines the structure of web pages.</i></p>

        <p style="color: blue;font-size: 20px;"><i>HTML is a markup language used by the browser to manipulate text, 
            images, and other content, in order to display it in the required format.
            HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991.
            The first-ever version of HTML was HTML 1.0, 
            but the first standard version was HTML 2.0, published in 1995</i></p>
